# Massively Multiplayer Online Pub Quiz

A way of creating and playing pub quizzes remotely.

## Creating a quiz

An admin section allows admin users to create a full quiz.

Questions are text - with accompanying media - that have a correct answer, or multiple correct answers. Points can be awarded to each question.

Answer types include:
* free text (including a number variant)
* multiple choice

Timers can be set for a question. This can be individually or globally across a quiz.

Non answer slides, such as introductions, breaks and outros are also options. These display information but do not have questions attached. Display information can include free text, images and/or a countdown.

Questions and answers will be stored, so a quiz can run at a later date, or repeated. The administrator will be able to delete a quiz.

## Doing a quiz

The admin section will allow question masters to set their quiz 'live'.

This will generate a unique code for the quiz. This can be sent to participants. The unique code will only need to be unique during the quiz itself. Codes can be reused over time.

### Question master

The question master view will be able to view the question list.

They will be able to see all the answered questions and their answers per person/team.

They will also be able to alter the timer for a question as the question is 'live'.

### Quiz display

The question text and additional question information will be displayed on screen.

There will be an option to switch between question display and question participation, for those on one device/screen.

### Quiz participation

A participant will need to enter a unique room code.

A participant will be able to enter their name (or a team name).

Once entered, they will wait until the quiz has begun.

During the quiz itself, their screen will display an input for their answer. This input will vary for simple text/number entry or multiple choice questions.

If there is a timer per question, this will count down as the question is live.

Participants will be able to rejoin their session. Anyone entering after the first question is complete will not be allowed to participate.

### Answers

The question master can determine whether the answers will be handled live, or after the fact. Answers handled after can be handled on any non answer slide.

Live reveals will award points immediately after a question is complete. This will allow for a live scoreboard, with live updates on how participants are performing. It can also display how many people got a correct answer.

Points can be assigned to correct answers automatically. The question master can override this manually, should there be reason to do so. They can also award half marks for close but incorrect answers.
